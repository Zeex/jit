JIT plugin for SA-MP server
===========================

https://github.com/Zeex/samp-jit-plugin

Introduction
------------

This package contains a Just-In-Time compiler for AMX version 3.2 and a SA-MP
(San Andreas Multiplayer) server plugin. Since SA-MP server runs only on x86 this
implementation supports only x86 (but may be extented to support x86_64 in
future...).

Plugin configuration
--------------------

The following `server.cfg` options are recognized by the plugin:

* `jit_dump_asm 0/1`

  Dumps assembly code generated by JIT to a text file named
  `<amx_path>/<amx_name>.asm`

* `jit_dump_bin 0/1`

  Dumps raw code to a binary file named `<amx_path>/<amx_name>.bin`
