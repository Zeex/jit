JIT plugin for SA-MP server
===========================

https://github.com/Zeex/samp-jit-plugin

Introduction
------------

This package contains a Just-In-Time compiler for AMX version 3.2 and a SA-MP
(San Andreas Multiplayer) server plugin. Since SA-MP server runs only on x86 this
implementation supports only x86 (but may be extented to support x86_64 in
future...).

Installation
------------

*	Windows

	Copy `jit.dll` to the `plugins` folder inside your server's root (create it
	if it doesn't exist) and add `jit` to the list of plugins in `server.cfg`.

*	Linux

	Copy `jit.so` to the `plugins` folder inside your server's root (create it
	if it doesn't exist) and add `jit.so` to the list of plugins in `server.cfg`.

Compilation
-----------

The simplest way of building this plugin from source is using CMake:

http://cmake.org

CMake is a cross-platform tool that can generate projects for the majority of
build systems and IDEs on both Linux and Windows.

Configuration
-------------

The following `server.cfg` options are recognized by the this plugin:

* `jit_dump_asm 0/1`

  Dumps assembly code generated by JIT to a text file named
  `<amx_path>/<amx_name>.asm`

* `jit_dump_bin 0/1`

  Dumps raw code to a binary file named `<amx_path>/<amx_name>.bin`
